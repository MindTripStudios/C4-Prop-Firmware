https://www.etsy.com/listing/1032389119/csgo-inspired-c4-prop

## Version 1.2.0
If the version on here is different from the version provided in your user manual, feel free to follow these instructions to update the firmware. Although these instructions are on Windows, they should be the same for both Mac and Linux.

## Setup

- Download [thonny](https://thonny.org/). It is an open source Python IDE that you will use to move files on to the prop.
- Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/MindTripStudios/C4-Prop-Firmware/releases) and download the zip with the source files.
- Extract the source zip somewhere that you will be able to find later
- Open the back of your prop using the included allen wrench. **BE CAREFUL!** The batteries are attached to the back panel so they will still be plugged in to the board.
- Using the included USB cable, plug the prop into your computer.

## Moving files

- Open Thonny. If you do not see a "Files" tab on the left hand side of the program, click "View > Files".
